# Introduction

### About Me

I am Ben Fielding and I work at Deparment for Work and Pensions, within the Digital Group, as an Apprentice DevOps engineer. My background is mainly in the private sector working within the parking industry. Some of my experience with technology was gained through configuring and repairing parking equipment. Prior to being made redundant in January 2020 I was department lead on a project to build and launch a parking app, which gave me some experience of writing tests, testing, doing user research and working in sprints. The process gave me a renewed interest in web development and the ways in which technology can make people's lives better or easier. After speaking to some people I knew who were working in the tech industry I decided to self-learn web development with Udemy and freeCodeCamp and apply for apprenticeships or entry level tech roles.

When the pandemic came along I took a position with DWP in one of the Working Age Habitual Residence Test teams as a Decision Maker. It was whilst working in this role, and still studying different aspects of the Web, that I saw an internal posting for the DevOps apprenticeship and applied. The apprenticeship started with an 18 week Makers Bootcamp to give us an overview of all aspects of programming, cloud technologies and DevOps specific skills and was an excellent grounding in the types of technology we would be using with DWP. I am excited to start my placement and work in the public sector providing infrastructure and platform support for Universal Credit, where I know I'll be helping ot make a difference to the lives of people who need some extra support.
