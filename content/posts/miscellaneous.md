# Miscellaneous Projects and tasks not ticketed

* Updated a script in the 'Getting Started' repo which gave me visibility of Team conventions ie branching the repo, submitting a merge request and notifying the correct Slack channel

* Looked at Go docs and then UCCLI cli. Familiarised myself with the codebase and then decided to pick off an easy first issue. The issue required a link to the relase page to be provided when the upgrade command is run. This was found in the update.go file and only required a `fmt.Printf` statement. Submitted merge request and talked through the CI/CD pipeline for the project with product owner.

* Prepare and deliver a presentation to non technical audience about DevOps and the infrastructure that Team Hack provision
