# Examples of course content covered in self led learning

### A Cloud Guru - Setting Up Lambda Functions with S3 Event Triggers

This was a 'hands on lab' which Cloud Guru describe as 'real environments created by industry experts to help you learn'. THe objective of this lab was to create a Lambda function for AWS with an S3 event trigger to execute the Lambda logic. This Lambda would then send an email.

### Terraform - Getting Started

This course is part of the Hashicorp Certified: Terraform Associate pathway on Pluralsight which acts as preparation for the certification exam.[(*K25*)]({{< ref "/posts/work-mapping-table#K25">}})

The course covers the basics of Infrastructure as code before getting into Terraform specifics. The first module covers essential foundational knowledge of Hashicorps Terraform software. In this I covered the foundations of writing, planning and creating automated Infrastructure deployments. It covered the basic Terraform configuration and then covered using functions,modules and worksapces which is very relevant for my placement role.

### Understanding IAM

This was an AWS Tech enablement session hosted by AWS and attended online via Teams. The hour long session covered IAM foundation principles, writing IAM policies and working towards least privilege when defining policies and permissions for cloud resources. There was a short quiz by the facilitator to check understanding.
